                   Apache HTTP Server 1.3.31 Released

   The Apache Software Foundation and The Apache HTTP Server Project are
   pleased to announce the release of version 1.3.31 of the Apache HTTP
   Server ("Apache").  This Announcement notes the significant changes
   in 1.3.31 as compared to 1.3.29 (1.3.30 was not released).  The
   Announcement is also available in German, Spanish and Japanese from:

   This version of Apache is principally a bug and security fix release.
   A partial summary of the bug fixes is given at the end of this document.
   A full listing of changes can be found in the CHANGES file.  Of
   particular note is that 1.3.31 addresses and fixes 4 potential
   security issues:

     o CAN-2003-0987 (cve.mitre.org)
       In mod_digest, verify whether the nonce returned in the client 
       response is one we issued ourselves.  This problem does not affect
       mod_auth_digest.

     o CAN-2003-0020 (cve.mitre.org)
       Escape arbitrary data before writing into the errorlog.

     o CAN-2004-0174 (cve.mitre.org)
       Fix starvation issue on listening sockets where a short-lived
       connection on a rarely-accessed listening socket will cause a
       child to hold the accept mutex and block out new connections until
       another connection arrives on that rarely-accessed listening socket.
       This only affects some platforms, such as Solaris, AIX and
       IRIX. Linux is unaffected.

     o CAN-2003-0993 (cve.mitre.org) 
       Fix parsing of Allow/Deny rules using IP addresses without a
       netmask; issue is only known to affect big-endian 64-bit
       platforms

   We consider Apache 1.3.31 to be the best version of Apache 1.3 available
   and we strongly recommend that users of older versions, especially of
   the 1.1.x and 1.2.x family, upgrade as soon as possible.  No further
   releases will be made in the 1.2.x family.

   Apache 1.3.31 is available for download from:

   Please consult the CHANGES_1.3 file for a full list of changes.

   As of Apache 1.3.12 binary distributions contain all standard Apache
   modules as shared objects (if supported by the platform) and include
   full source code.  Installation is easily done by executing the
   included install script.  See the README.bindist and INSTALL.bindist
   files for a complete explanation.  Please note that the binary
   distributions are only provided for your convenience and current
   distributions for specific platforms are not always available.  Win32
   binary distributions are based on the Microsoft Installer (.MSI)
   technology.  While development continues to make this installation method
   more robust, questions should be directed to the
   news:comp.infosystems.www.servers.ms-windows newsgroup.

   For an overview of new features introduced after 1.2 please see
   
   http://httpd.apache.org/docs/new_features_1_3.html

   In general, Apache 1.3 offers several substantial improvements over
   version 1.2, including better performance, reliability and a wider
   range of supported platforms, including Windows NT and 2000 (which
   fall under the "Win32" label), OS2, Netware, and TPF threaded
   platforms.

   Apache is the most popular web server in the known universe; over half
   of the servers on the Internet are running Apache or one of its
   variants.

   IMPORTANT NOTE FOR APACHE USERS:   Apache 1.3 was designed for Unix OS
   variants.  While the ports to non-Unix platforms (such as Win32, Netware
   or OS2) are of an acceptable quality, Apache 1.3 is not optimized for
   these platforms.  Security, stability, or performance issues on these
   non-Unix ports do not generally apply to the Unix version, due to
   software's Unix origin.

   Apache 2.0 has been structured for multiple operating systems from its 
   inception, by introducing the Apache Portability Library and MPM modules.
   Users on non-Unix platforms are strongly encouraged to move up to 
   Apache 2.0 for better performance, stability and security on their
   platforms.

                     Apache 1.3.31 Major changes

  Security vulnerabilities

     * CAN-2003-0987 (cve.mitre.org)
       In mod_digest, verify whether the nonce returned in the client 
       response is one we issued ourselves.  This problem does not affect
       mod_auth_digest.

     * CAN-2003-0020 (cve.mitre.org)
       Escape arbitrary data before writing into the errorlog.

     * CAN-2004-0174 (cve.mitre.org)
       Fix starvation issue on listening sockets where a short-lived
       connection on a rarely-accessed listening socket will cause a
       child to hold the accept mutex and block out new connections until
       another connection arrives on that rarely-accessed listening socket.

     * CAN-2003-0993 (cve.mitre.org) 
       Fix parsing of Allow/Deny rules using IP addresses without a
       netmask; issue is only known to affect big-endian 64-bit
       platforms

  New features

   New features that relate to specific platforms:

     * Linux 2.4+: If Apache is started as root and you code
       CoreDumpDirectory, core dumps are enabled via the prctl() syscall.

   New features that relate to all platforms:

     * Add mod_whatkilledus and mod_backtrace (experimental) for
       reporting diagnostic information after a child process crash.

     * Add fatal exception hook for running diagnostic code after a
       crash.  

     * Forensic logging module added (mod_log_forensic)
     
     * '%X' is now accepted as an alias for '%c' in the
       LogFormat directive. This allows you to configure logging
       to still log the connection status even with mod_ssl

  Bugs fixed

   The following noteworthy bugs were found in Apache 1.3.29 (or earlier)
   and have been fixed in Apache 1.3.31:

     * Fix memory corruption problem with ap_custom_response() function.
       The core per-dir config would later point to request pool data
       that would be reused for different purposes on different requests.

     * mod_usertrack no longer inspects the Cookie2 header for
       the cookie name. It also no longer overwrites other cookies.

     * Fix bug causing core dump when using CookieTracking without
       specifying a CookieName directly.

     * UseCanonicalName off was ignoring the client provided
       port information.
