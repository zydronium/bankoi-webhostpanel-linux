We got it working! And here's how! Apologies for the size, but we wanted to post an explicit step-by-step procedure. Your layout and assumptions may differ, but you should be able to make the appropriate changes. 

Configuring FrontPage 2000 Extensions on Linux OS & Apache Web Server 

Background assumptions:
1. User to own Frontpage files: www
2. Group to own Frontpage files: www
3. Apache install directory: (custom): /var/www/apache
4. Frontpage install directory: (default): /usr/local/frontpage
5. Frontpage version 4.0 ("2000 extensions")
6. Apache version: 1.3.19
7. Root access is enabled with sudo
8. Tar files are located in /var/www/tars/{apache,fp}


***
For Apache 1.3.22, two additional changes need to be made:
1. the patch doesn't apply cleanly; add this line before "char *filename;" in src/include/httpd.h around line 800:

char *execfilename;

do this step after running the patch command.

2. apache wouldn't start correctly until we changed this line in conf/httpd.conf from:
Group "#-1"
to:
Group nogroup
Adjust the user and group for your site.
***

# Create the user/group

$ sudo adduser www
(On Linux, this also creates a group of the same name)

# remove any previous instance of apache

$ sudo /var/www/apache/bin/apachectl stop
/var/www/apache/bin/apachectl stop: httpd stopped
$ sudo rm -rf /var/www/apache
$ sudo mkdir /var/www/apache

# remove any previous frontpage install

$ sudo rm -rf /usr/local/frontpage

# remove any extensions that were installed in the web root

$ sudo rm -rf /var/www/apache/htdocs/_vti*

# extract apache

$ cd /var/www/tars/apache
$ sudo rm -rf apache_1.3.19
$ sudo tar xf apache_1.3.19.tar

# copy and apply frontpage patch

$ sudo cp ../fp/frontpage/version4.0/apache-fp/fp-* apache_1.3.19
$ cd apache_1.3.19
$ sudo patch -p0 < fp-*

# configure apache with custom prefix and with frontpage module

$ sudo ./configure --prefix=/var/www/apache --add-module=mod_frontpage.c 

# compile and install apache

$ sudo make && sudo make install

# make changes to /var/www/apache/conf/httpd.conf

- change Port from 8080 to 80 (this step didn't seem to be necessary)

- change AllowOverride from "None" to "All" all four places

- Add the following lines:
ResourceConfig /dev/null 
AccessConfig /dev/null 

- Removed double quotes ("") from 7 lines
Old lines look like this:
ServerRoot "/var/www/apache"
DocumentRoot "/var/www/apache/htdocs"
<Directory "/var/www/apache/htdocs">
Alias /icons/ "/var/www/apache/icons/"
<Directory "/var/www/apache/icons">
ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ "/var/www/apache/cgi-bin/"
<Directory "/var/www/apache/cgi-bin">

New lines look like this:

ServerRoot /var/www/apache
DocumentRoot /var/www/apache/htdocs
<Directory /var/www/apache/htdocs>
Alias /icons/ /var/www/apache/icons/
<Directory /var/www/apache/icons>
ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /var/www/apache/cgi-bin/
<Directory /var/www/apache/cgi-bin>

# start apache

$ sudo /var/www/apache/bin/apachectl start

# surf to http://<hostname> that apache is working

# install Frontpage

$ cd /var/www/tars/fp/frontpage/version4.0
$ sudo ./fp_install.sh

This script will step the user through upgrading existing and installing new servers and webs. As with any software installation, a backup should be done before continuing. It is recommended that the FrontPage installation directory, server configuration file directory, and all web content be backed up before continuing with this installation. 

Are you satisfied with your backup of the system (y/n) [N]? y 

Directory /usr/local exists.
Root has necessary access to /usr/local. 

Where would you like to install the FrontPage Extensions. If you select a location other than /usr/local/frontpage/ then a symbolic link will be created from /usr/local/frontpage/ to the location that is chosen. 

FrontPage Extensions directory [/usr/local/frontpage/]:

Preparing to chown webs...

Your webs have been upgraded to use the new Apache-fp Server. The next step is to chown the web in order to guarantee that the extensions will work properly. At this point you have two options:

1. This script will prompt you interactively for an owner and group of each web and then perform the chown. If you do not have a lot of webs you might want to choose this option.
2. This script will generate a script, which you can edit to fill in the owner and group for each web, to run at a later date. If you have a large number of webs you might want to choose this option.
Would you like to be prompted interactively for each webs owner/group (y/n) [Y]? y
